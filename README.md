# TriviaGame

## Introduction :
This is a stand trivia game that uses JQUERY and JAVASCRIPT TIMER technology , and CSS framework ,Bootstrap . This game showcases the excelent usage of DOM manipulation as exhibited in the functions that leads to win loss or time out scenarios, and user of **TIMERS** to delay a function from running which ultamately achieves the goal of displaying the photo associated to the scenario (win/loss/time out) . The main highlight of this web page is to **demonstrate** my proficiency on JQUERY and JAVASCRIPT technology . Using jquery , the questionares are generated by random, picked from the array of questions, on that said array , the answer is then matched to the users pick . The game also has 2 modes , depending on the players choice "FUN or SERIOUS ", it will display the answers corresponding to that user choice .

You have 10 seconds to figure out the answer , **trivial as it is ,it is your body after all..** . You can choose if you want the serious or fun mode .
