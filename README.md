### Version 0.1 04/22/19

> Initial HTML layout using bootstrap on file Index.html

> Initial PsuedoCode on game.js

> Researching how to tackle this problem , see the psuedocode on javascript file .

> The plan initially is to have the counter as a "sticky" per css specifications. This might change , although i have the columns ready if i decided to go this route. 

> The theme that I chose is "anything" , this would be the first tier of the questions , then something specific . i will also add a bonus round ,I think my javascript skills are kinda on point? (IF YOU SEE THIS REDACTED , THAT MEANS I WAS WRONG HEHE OR I RAN OUT OF TIME :) )
