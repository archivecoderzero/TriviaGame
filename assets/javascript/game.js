// PSUEDO CODE //

// Create variables, equeal to the object, of which the randomizer will pick the order of the questions that is going to be displayed .

// Create a timer that counts backwards.it is initalized by the "start now " button from the jumbrtron .when that time strikes zero, it will display message which tells the player that he lost a turn. Will come back to this later.

// Create a question that has 4 choices , the user will pick 1 out of the 4 and it will display if the user has it right , incorporate the time on each question, when the user picks an answer , display corresponding choices, probably you need to create an object here. if you want to randomize the questions being asked , you probably need to put in an object . 

// Create an event whenever the user click an answer, it verifies if the the answert clicked was the correct answer. for fun stuff , you can also put in an onclick event whenver the user clicks outside the range , like change the css backround or make the background static .

// Every time the user clicks a "choice" , the function verifies if it is the right or wrong answer and tells the user by displaying a funny gif . 

// after questions , show the stats of the player and then reroll the function to pick from the object at random , if you have time , you can also have the user pick the theme of questions , then change the css background based on that choice,,,IF YOU HAVE TIME ..

// for fun stuff , include something like a music and a sound when the user picks something..
